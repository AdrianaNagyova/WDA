## The Beginning
Roger Federer began playing tennis when he was eight years old. By the time he was ten, people were already talking about Roger's sweet touch with the racket and his competitive attitude. Roger would sometimes beat other kids his age so badly they would start crying and Roger would often cry and smash rackets himself if he ever lost a match. Roger left home when he was 13 to train at a top-rated tennis academy in Switzerland and was the number one ranked junior player in the world by the time he was 16.

## The Swiss Master
In 1998, Roger Federer began playing on the professional tennis circuit. He won his first **ATP tournament** in Milan in 2001 and quickly worked his way up the men's world tennis rankings. In 2003, he won six tournments including his first **Grand Slam tournament** by defeating Mark Philippoussis at ***Wimbledon***. By 2004, Federer was the number one ranked tennis player on the planet and won three of the four *Grand Slam tournaments* that year including Wimbledon, the US Open and the Australian Open. Federer has since gone onto win twelve more Grand Slam titles, bringing his grand total up to 13. Roger has won the US Open five times and the Aussie Open, three times. The only major tournament that he has not won is the French Open in Paris.

## The Best Ever?
Roger Federer's professional tennis career is still quite young, but some are predicting he could beat *Pete Sampras'* record of 14 Grand Slam tennis titles in 2009. Federer is an extremely intelligent tennis player who's known for his dominating forehand and rarely making mistakes on the court. He has already won **13 Grand Slam titles** and his smart, consistent play means he'll be a favorite to win several more before his career is over.
